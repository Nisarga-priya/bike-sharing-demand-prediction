## Problem Statement:

A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, has been facing considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it challenging to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands.
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Business Goal
The objective of this project is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Methodology
The project will follow a supervised machine learning approach. We will be using linear regression to model the demand for shared bikes. We will start by performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between the variables. Then we will preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling the data. We will create dummy variables for categorical features, and then split the data into training and testing sets.

Next, we will build the linear regression model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. We will use various regression evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance and make improvements if required.

Finally, we will interpret the model coefficients to understand which features are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those features describe the bike demands.

## Repository Structure

The following files and folders are present in this repository:

bike-sharing-assignment.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.

day.csv: the dataset used for this project.

README.md: a file describing the project and repository.

# Conclusion
The linear regression model will help BoomBikes to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market. By manipulating the business strategy based on the model predictions, BoomBikes can meet the demand levels and customer expectations. The model will also be useful for understanding the demand dynamics of a new market.
